## Overview

Removes merged local branches, prunes stale remote-tracking references, optionally deletes merged remote branches, and runs garbage collection to reduce repository size.

## Requirements

| Dependency | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `git` | Git version control system |

## Usage

```bash
utilux run git-clean [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--all` | `-a` | Run all cleanup tasks |
| `--merged` | `-m` | Delete merged local branches |
| `--remote` | `-r` | Delete merged remote branches |
| `--prune` | `-p` | Prune remote tracking branches |
| `--gc` | `-g` | Run garbage collection |
| `--dry-run` | `-n` | Show what would be done |
| `--branch NAME` | `-b` | Use NAME as default branch |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help |

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Delete local merged branches (default)
utilux run git-clean

# Preview what would be deleted
utilux run git-clean -n

# Run all cleanup tasks
utilux run git-clean -a
```

### Selective Cleanup

```bash
# Delete merged + prune remotes
utilux run git-clean -m -p

# Prune remote tracking only
utilux run git-clean -p

# Garbage collection only
utilux run git-clean -g
```

### Custom Default Branch

```bash
# Use develop as default branch
utilux run git-clean -b develop

# Clean against main branch
utilux run git-clean -b main
```

### Remote Branch Cleanup

```bash
# Preview remote branch deletion
utilux run git-clean -r -n

# Delete merged remote branches (with confirmation)
utilux run git-clean -r
```

## What Gets Cleaned

### Local Merged Branches (`-m`)
- Branches merged into default branch (main/master)
- Excludes: main, master, develop, dev
- Uses `git branch -d` (safe delete)

### Remote Tracking (`-p`)
- Stale remote-tracking references
- Branches deleted on remote but still tracked locally
- Uses `git remote prune origin`

### Remote Branches (`-r`)
- Merged branches on remote (origin)
- Requires confirmation before deletion
- Uses `git push origin --delete`

### Garbage Collection (`-g`)
- Compresses loose objects
- Removes unreachable objects
- Reduces `.git` directory size

## Protected Branches

These branches are never deleted:
- `main`
- `master`
- `develop`
- `dev`

## Troubleshooting

### Branch not fully merged

**Problem:** Cannot delete branch, not fully merged

**Solution:** Branch has unmerged changes. Either merge or force delete:
```bash
git branch -D branch-name  # Force delete (use with caution)
```

### Not a git repository

**Problem:** Error running in non-git directory

**Solution:** Navigate to repository root:
```bash
cd /path/to/repo
utilux run git-clean
```

### Permission denied on remote

**Problem:** Cannot delete remote branches

**Solution:** Ensure you have push access:
```bash
git remote -v  # Check remote URL
# May need to re-authenticate
```

### Default branch not detected

**Problem:** Cannot determine default branch

**Solution:** Specify explicitly:
```bash
utilux run git-clean -b main
```
